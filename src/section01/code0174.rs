//
// The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon.
// The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid.
// Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.
//
// The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer.
// If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
//
// Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers),
// so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0)
// or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).
//
// To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
//
// Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.
//
// Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups,
// even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
