//
// Hard
//
// You are given an undirected weighted tree with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. It is represented by a 2D integer array
// edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi with weight wi.â€‹
//
// Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array queries, where queries[j] = [src1j, src2j, destj].
//
// Return an array answer of length equal to queries.length, where answer[j] is the minimum total weight of a subtree such
// that it is possible to reach destj from both src1j and src2j using edges in this subtree.
//
// A subtree here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original tree forming a valid tree.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries = [[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]
//
// Output: [12,11]
//
// Explanation:
//
// The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.
//
//     answer[0]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 2 and src2 = 3 to dest = 4 is 3 + 5 + 4 = 12.
//
//     answer[1]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 2 to dest = 5 is 2 + 3 + 6 = 11.
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input: edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]
//
// Output: [15]
//
// Explanation:
//
//     answer[0]: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from src1 = 0 and src2 = 1 to dest = 2 is 8 + 7 = 15.
//
// Constraints:
//
//     3 <= n <= 10^5
//     edges.length == n - 1
//     edges[i].length == 3
//     0 <= ui, vi < n
//     1 <= wi <= 10^4
//     1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
//     queries[j].length == 3
//     0 <= src1j, src2j, destj < n
//     src1j, src2j, and destj are pairwise distinct.
//     The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
