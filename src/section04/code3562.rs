// Hard
//
// You are given an integer n, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from 1 to n,
// and employee 1 is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, present and future, each of length n, where:
//
//     present[i] represents the current price at which the ith employee can buy a stock today.
//     future[i] represents the expected price at which the ith employee can sell the stock tomorrow.
//
// The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array hierarchy, where hierarchy[i] = [ui, vi] means that employee ui is the direct boss of employee vi.
//
// Additionally, you have an integer budget representing the total funds available for investment.
//
// However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock,
// then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price (floor(present[v] / 2)).
//
// Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget.
//
// Note:
//
//     You may buy each stock at most once.
//     You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from budget.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: n = 2, present = [1,2], future = [4,3], hierarchy = [[1,2]], budget = 3
//
// Output: 5
//
// Explanation:
//
//     Employee 1 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 4 - 1 = 3.
//     Since Employee 1 is the direct boss of Employee 2, Employee 2 gets a discounted price of floor(2 / 2) = 1.
//     Employee 2 buys the stock at price 1 and earns a profit of 3 - 1 = 2.
//     The total buying cost is 1 + 1 = 2 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 2 = 5.
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input: n = 2, present = [3,4], future = [5,8], hierarchy = [[1,2]], budget = 4
//
// Output: 4
//
// Explanation:
//
//     Employee 2 buys the stock at price 4 and earns a profit of 8 - 4 = 4.
//     Since both employees cannot buy together, the maximum profit is 4.
//
// Example 3:
//
// Input: n = 3, present = [4,6,8], future = [7,9,11], hierarchy = [[1,2],[1,3]], budget = 10
//
// Output: 10
//
// Explanation:
//
//     Employee 1 buys the stock at price 4 and earns a profit of 7 - 4 = 3.
//     Employee 3 would get a discounted price of floor(8 / 2) = 4 and earns a profit of 11 - 4 = 7.
//     Employee 1 and Employee 3 buy their stocks at a total cost of 4 + 4 = 8 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 7 = 10.
//
// Example 4:
//
// Input: n = 3, present = [5,2,3], future = [8,5,6], hierarchy = [[1,2],[2,3]], budget = 7
//
// Output: 12
//
// Explanation:
//
//     Employee 1 buys the stock at price 5 and earns a profit of 8 - 5 = 3.
//     Employee 2 would get a discounted price of floor(2 / 2) = 1 and earns a profit of 5 - 1 = 4.
//     Employee 3 would get a discounted price of floor(3 / 2) = 1 and earns a profit of 6 - 1 = 5.
//     The total cost becomes 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 <= budget. Thus, the maximum total profit achieved is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
//
// Constraints:
//
//     1 <= n <= 160
//     present.length, future.length == n
//     1 <= present[i], future[i] <= 50
//     hierarchy.length == n - 1
//     hierarchy[i] == [ui, vi]
//     1 <= ui, vi <= n
//     ui != vi
//     1 <= budget <= 160
//     There are no duplicate edges.
//     Employee 1 is the direct or indirect boss of every employee.
//     The input graph hierarchy is guaranteed to have no cycles.
//
