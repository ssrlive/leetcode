// 3320. Count The Number of Winning Sequences

// Hard
//
// Alice and Bob are playing a fantasy battle game consisting of n rounds where they summon one of three magical creatures each round:
// a Fire Dragon, a Water Serpent, or an Earth Golem. In each round, players simultaneously summon their creature and are awarded points as follows:
//
//     If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.
//     If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.
//     If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.
//     If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.
//
// You are given a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round:
//
//     If s[i] == 'F', Alice summons a Fire Dragon.
//     If s[i] == 'W', Alice summons a Water Serpent.
//     If s[i] == 'E', Alice summons an Earth Golem.
//
// Bobâ€™s sequence of moves is unknown, but it is guaranteed that Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds.
// Bob beats Alice if the total number of points awarded to Bob after n rounds is strictly greater than the points awarded to Alice.
//
// Return the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.
//
// Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: s = "FFF"
//
// Output: 3
//
// Explanation:
//
// Bob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: "WFW", "FWF", or "WEW".
// Note that other winning sequences like "WWE" or "EWW" are invalid since Bob cannot make the same move twice in a row.
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input: s = "FWEFW"
//
// Output: 18
//
// Explanation:
//
// Bob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: "FWFWF", "FWFWE", "FWEFE", "FWEWE", "FEFWF", "FEFWE",
// "FEFEW", "FEWFE", "WFEFE", "WFEWE", "WEFWF", "WEFWE", "WEFEF", "WEFEW", "WEWFW", "WEWFE", "EWFWE", or "EWEWE".
//
// Constraints:
//
//     1 <= s.length <= 1000
//     s[i] is either 'F', 'W', or 'E'.
//
