// 2742. Painting the Walls

//
// Hard
//
// You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing the costs and
// the time taken to paint n different walls respectively. There are two painters available:
//
//     - A paid painter that paints the ith wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of money.
//     - A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter can only
//       be used if the paid painter is already occupied.
//
// Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 1 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 3 units of time;
// meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 2 and 3, free of cost in 2 units of time.
// Thus, the total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The walls at index 0 and 3 will be painted by the paid painter, and it will take 2 units of time;
// meanwhile, the free painter will paint the walls at index 1 and 2, free of cost in 2 units of time.
// Thus, the total cost is 2 + 2 = 4.
//
// Constraints:
//
//     1 <= cost.length <= 500
//     cost.length == time.length
//     1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6
//     1 <= time[i] <= 500
//
