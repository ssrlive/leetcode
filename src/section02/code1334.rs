//
// Medium
//
// There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents
// a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.
//
// Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most distanceThreshold,
// If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.
//
// Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
//
// Example 1:
//
// Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
// The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
// City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]
// City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]
// City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]
// City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]
// Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
// The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
// City 0 -> [City 1]
// City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]
// City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]
// City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
// City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]
// The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.
//
// Constraints:
//
// -    2 <= n <= 100
// -    1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
// -    edges[i].length == 3
// -    0 <= fromi < toi < n
// -    1 <= weighti,Â distanceThreshold <= 10^4
// -    All pairs (fromi, toi) are distinct.
